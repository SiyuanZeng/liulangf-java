 * From <<Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests>>
 * A test fixture is the fixed state that exists at the start of a test.
 * A test fixture ensures that a test is repeatable-every time a test is run it starts 
 * in the same state so it should produce the same results. A fixture may be set up before 
 * the test runs and torn down after it has finished.
