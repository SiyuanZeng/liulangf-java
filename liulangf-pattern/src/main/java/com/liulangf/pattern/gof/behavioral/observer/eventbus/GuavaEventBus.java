 * 
 * Google Guava in version number 10 introduced new package eventbus with a few very interesting classes to 
 * deal with listener (or publisher – subscriber) use case.
 * 
 *  It’s a very elegant and easy to apply solution when you need to listen for some events and publish them 
 *  without creating sophisticated classes and interfaces hierarchy. 
 * 
 *  <ul>
 *    <li>To listen to some events we need a listener class.</li>
 *    <li>And of course we need an event class to send it around.</li>
 *  </ul>
