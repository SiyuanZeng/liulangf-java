     * <p>A method call is an abstraction barrier intended to shield you from the details of what happens 
     * on the other side. But because you don't know what is happening on the other side of the call, 
     * calling an alien method with a lock held is difficult to analyze and therefore risky.
     * 
     * <p>Calling a method with no locks held is called an open call [CPJ 2.4.1.3], and classes that rely 
     * on open calls are more well-behaved and composable than classes that make calls with locks held. 
     * Using open calls to avoid deadlock is analogous to using encapsulation to provide thread safety: 
     * while one can certainly construct a thread-safe program without any encapsulation, the thread safety 
     * analysis of a program that makes effective use of encapsulation is far easier than that of one that 
     * does not. Similarly, the liveness analysis of a program that relies exclusively on open calls is far 
     * easier than that of one that does not. Restricting yourself to open calls makes it far easier to identify 
     * the code paths that acquire multiple locks and therefore to ensure that locks are acquired in a consistent 
     * order.
