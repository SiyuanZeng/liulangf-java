 * 
 * Actors Model:
 * A general model of concurrent computation developed by CarlHewitt, HenryBaker and GulAgha(also "actor model").
 * Actors are autonomous[自治的] and concurrent objects which execute asynchronously. The actors model provides
 * flexible mechanisms for building parallel and distributed software systems.
 * 
 * In computer science, the Actor model is a mathematical model of concurrent computation that treats "actors" 
 * as the universal primitives of concurrent digital computation: in response to a message that it receives, 
 * an actor can make local decisions, create more actors, send more messages, and determine how to respond to 
 * the next message received. The Actor model originated in 1973.[1] It has been used both as a framework for 
 * a theoretical understanding of computation, and as the theoretical basis for several practical implementations 
 * of concurrent systems.

	 * As the number of cores in our servers increase, concurrent programming continues to rise in importance. 
	 * Most concurrent programming today focuses on shared memory and concurrency control via locking. 
	 * However, an alternative paradigm called *actor-based concurrency* has been rising in visibility with languages 
	 * like Erlang and Scala. We’ll look at how actor-based concurrency differs from shared memory programming and 
	 * how it can be utilized in languages like Erlang, Scala, and Java.
