/**
 * One of the biggest promises java EE6 made, was to ease the use of dependency injection. They did, using CDI. 
 * CDI, which stands for Contexts and Dependency Injection for Java EE, offers a base set to 
 * apply dependency injection in your enterprise application.
 * 
 * Before CDI, EJB 3 also introduced dependency injection, but this was a bit basic. 
 * You could inject an EJB (statefull or stateless) into another EJB or Servlet 
 * (if you container supported this). Offcourse not every application needs EJBâ€™s, 
 * that is why CDI is gaining so much popularity.
