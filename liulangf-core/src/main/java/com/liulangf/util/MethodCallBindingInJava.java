/**
 * <<Thinking in Java>>.

 * Connecting a method call to a method body is called binding.When binding is performed before the
 * program is run(by the compiler and linker, if there is one), it's called early binding(static binding).
 * 
 * Late binding is also called dynamic binding or runtime binding: which means that the binding occures at
 * run time based on the type of object.
 * 
 * All method binding in Java uses late binding unless the method is static or final(private methods are
 * implicitly final).
