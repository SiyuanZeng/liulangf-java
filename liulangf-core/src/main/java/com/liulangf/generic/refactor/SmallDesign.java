	 * <ul>
	 *  <li>an ethos of simple design,</li> 
	 *  <li>test-first programming, </li>
	 *  <li>and refactoring. </li>
	 * </ul>

	 * Test-first programming is an approach that says, "Write a test, see it fail, write code, see the test pass." 
	 * When you put all of these together, you get what is now called test-driven development.
