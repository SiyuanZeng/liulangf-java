 * A coded character set is a character set (a collection of characters) where each character has been assigned a unique number. 
 * At the core of the Unicode standard is a coded character set that assigns the letter "A" the number 004116 and the letter "‚Ç¨" 
 * (the symbol for the euro currency) the number 20AC16. The Unicode standard always uses hexadecimal numbers, and writes them 
 * with the prefix "U+", so the number for "A" is written as "U+0041".
