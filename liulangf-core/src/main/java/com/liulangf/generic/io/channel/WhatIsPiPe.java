 * A pipe, in the general sense, is a conduit through which data can be passed in a single direction 
 * between two entities. The notion of a pipe has long been familiar to users of Unix (and Unix-like) 
 * operating systems. Pipes are used on Unix systems to connect the output of one process to the input of 
 * another. The Pipe class implements a pipe paradigm, but the pipes it creates are intraprocess 
 * (within the JVM process) rather than interprocess (between processes).
