 * 
 * There are quite a lot of things the traditional Java I/O model can't handle.
 * Things like non-blocking modes, file locks, readiness selection, scatter/gather, and so on.
 * 
 * NIO is not a replacement for the older I/O classes.
 * 
 * The top ten new things you can do with Nio:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>File Locking</li>
 *   <li>Regular Expressions Built into the String Class</li>
 *   <li>Buffer Views</li>
 *   <li>Byte Swapping</li>
 *   <li>Direct Buffers</li>
 *   <li>Memory-Mapped Files</li>
 *   <li>Scattering Reads and Gathering Writes</li>
 *   <li>Direct Channel Transfers</li>
 *   <li>Non-Blocking Sockets</li>
 *   <li>Multiplexed I/O</li>
 * </ul>
