/**
 * Self-bounding takes the extra step of forcing the generic to be used as its own bound argument.
 * 
 * The self-bounding constraint serves only to force the inheritance relationship. 
 * If you use self-bounding, you know that the type parameter used by the class will 
 * be the same basic type as the class thatâ€™s using that parameter. 
 * It forces anyone using that class to follow that form.
 * 
 * Self-referential generic types are often used to express in a supertype that its subtypes depend on themselves.
