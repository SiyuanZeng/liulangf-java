/**
 * Typically you use sockets because your program needs to provide information to, or use information provided by, 
 * another program. There is no magic: any programs that exchange information must agree on how that information 
 * will be encoded—represented as a sequence of bits—as well as which program sends what information when, and 
 * how the information received affects the behavior of the program. This agreement regarding the form and meaning 
 * of information exchanged over a communication channel is called a protocol; a protocol used in implementing a 
 * particular application is an application protocol.
