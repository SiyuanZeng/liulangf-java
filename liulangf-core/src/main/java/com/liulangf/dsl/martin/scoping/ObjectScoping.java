	 * A DSL can use this facility by defining DSL functions on a base class, and then allowing developers 
	 * to write DSL programs in subclasses. The base class can also define fields to hold any parsing data 
	 * that's required.
	 * 
	 * Using a base class like this is an obvious place for an Expression Builder. 
	 * Clients then write DSL programs in a subclass of the Expression Builder. 
	 * Using inheritance allows them to add other DSL functions in the subclass, or even override base functions 
	 * in the DSL object if they need to.
