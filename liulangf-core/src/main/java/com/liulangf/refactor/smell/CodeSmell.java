	 * Smells (especially code smells) are warning signs about potential problems in code. 
	 * Not all smells indicate a problem, but most are worthy of a look and a decision.
	 * 
	 * Some people dislike the term smell, and prefer to talk about potential problems or flaws, 
	 * but I think smell is a good metaphor.
